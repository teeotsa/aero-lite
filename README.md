# Aero Lite
This script will enable/disable hidden **Aero Lite** theme on **Windows 8/8.1** (Admin Privileges required)

Verified to work with "**Windows 8 Pro (2012)** & **Windows 8.1 Pro**". Might not work with **Windows 10**

# How to remove this theme?

You can do it from the Control Panel, simply change your theme. Another solution is to run "**disableAeroLite.ps1**" script inside the folder!
